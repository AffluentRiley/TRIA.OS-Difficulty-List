**GUIDELINES IN ADDING TRIA MAPS**

Welcome to the official TRIA.os Difficulty List, a map list dedicated 
to listing the hardest recognized maps of TRIA.os. If you are in need
of extra help, you can reach out in our server here:
https://discord.gg/gzY665w2K2

Instructions on contributing are also available in the server, at `#how-to-contribute`.

FORMAT FOR ADDING AN ENTRY:
(LIST NO.) **Map Name** by Creators [ID] [YouTube Video Link]

EXAMPLE:
2. **Kneeling Shore** by Tac_taillike [10148804609/kneeling] [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEGJxiDmx6Y]

-- GENERAL GUIDELINES
1. The entry for new submissions must be a recognized map of TRIA.
2. Maps must not be a challenge or buff to an already existing map.
3. Entries being submitted must be QUALITY maps (No layout maps please).
4. No joke maps.
5. The admins have the right to reject your submissions based on varying factors.
6. If a map is currently broken and is seeking fixes, please label the map as (BROKEN) before the Map Name, also **bold** formatted.
7. Should you be unsure of a map's worthiness to be added, reach out to us in the official Discord.

-- FORMAT GUIDELINES
1. If there are multiple creators, please list your team name instead.
2. If your map does not have a team name, list the main creator/host instead.
3. If the map has a custom ID (Generally found in featured maps), please list in the ID as `numerical ID/custom ID`. Example: `10148804609/kneeling`
4. The YouTube video has to be a map completion video (Perferably the official verification video). Nothing else.

Again if you have any questions, feel free to contact us on Discord!
